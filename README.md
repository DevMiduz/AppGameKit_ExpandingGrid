# Expanding Grid Library
A grid which can be easily expanded created using AppGameKit.

## Library Goals
* Create a grid which expands outwords from a 0, 0 coordinate.
* Coords on the left will be negative.
* Coords on the right will be positive.
* This way it will be easy to keep the positions of the existing tiles the same.
* Expanding by 1 should expand by 1 on both sides (width) and increment the height by 2.

Example:
    -2 -1 0 1 2\
  0\
  1\
  2\
